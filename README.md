## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

I really can call this project one of my hardest some things were funny to me and most were trickish. Well, instead of learning many new things. I am having troubles with things. Well, just check the live site and you'll figure it out in no time. Don't forget to check the mobile version.

### Continued development

I really would love to focus on more of these;

- JavaScript.
- Navigations.
- Sass.
- Many more things that you can suggest for me. Send me a mail @ [My mailbox](efejamb@gmail.com)

### Challenges

The challenges I faced while building this wonderful room project were frustrating but I call on anyone to help me with them

- I was unable to do some fancy transitions on my hover state of the menu items.
- Yes, I couldn't change the color of this ` SVG ` on hover state. The ` SVG ` was nested in an ` img ` tag. This is the code block.
```html
<img src="images/icon-arrow.svg" alt="">
```
- For the mobile, the navigation after clicking on the hamburger, there was nothing fo me to do to make the menu go away after clicking it again. Simply put, the toggle wasn't functioning.
Thanks.
